|| code conforms to some packaging standard|4|
|| code has can be downloaded from some standard package manager|4|
| |workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|4|

|| License: exists|4|
|| DOI badge: exists |4|
||Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |4|
||Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |4|
||Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|4|
||Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|4|
||Docs: 3 minute video, posted to YouTube. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|4|

| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|4|
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|4|
| | evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|4|
| low-regressions rule | (hard to judge) features released are not subsequently removed|4|
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|4|
